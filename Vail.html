			<p>Vail’s wide variety of terrain, back bowls, and 5,289 skiable acres are one-of-a-kind. Paired with pristine conditions, skiing Vail is truly like no mountain you’ve experienced before. Thanks to the magical combination of averaging more than 300+ days of sunshine and 370+ inches of snow each year, the phrase "Like nothing on Earth" comes to life before your very eyes. Step into Vail Village and you feel like you’re in another world. As you stroll on the heated cobblestone streets, drink in the European vibe and explore the alpine-inspired architecture, Vail Village will charm you from your first step. And our impeccable service ensures you’ll be right at home through it all!!</p>
